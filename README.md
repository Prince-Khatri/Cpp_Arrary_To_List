# Cpp_Arrary_To_List
Just a program written by beginner to convert array in cpp --> List in py

So I was working on some things while working on college stuff .
I had learnt py in my +2 ,then i was introduced to cpp in college .
But it was very complicated as in this Array is a different concept as in py;
So I tried to convert the CPP Int array into List of py;
Don't judge Procedure oriented approach as I was unaware of OOP while I was working on this .
Can I call this project ðŸ˜….
